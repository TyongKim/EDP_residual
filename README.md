# EDP_residual

## Software introduction
This software predicts the standard deviation and correlation of EDP residuals using deep neural network (DNN) models. This page shares codes to construct database and develop DNN models. Note that due to the storage issue, the constructued database would not be shared but the trained DNN models can be downloaded.

## Developers
Developed by Chulyoung Kang (cykang@kaeri.re.kr), Taeyong Kim (tyong.kim@mail.utoronto.ca), Oh-Sung Kwon (os.kwon@utoronto.ca), and Junho Song (junhosong@snu.ac.kr)
